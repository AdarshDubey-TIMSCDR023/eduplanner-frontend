## Overview

EduPlanner is a full-stack academic task management system that helps students organize, track, and manage assignments efficiently.

The system enables real-time task operations including creation, updating, deletion, filtering, and searching with a clean and responsive interface.

---

## System Architecture



The application follows a **three-tier architecture**:

* **Frontend (Vercel)** – Handles UI and user interaction
* **Backend (Render)** – Processes API requests
* **Database (MongoDB Atlas)** – Stores task data

---

## Live Demo

Frontend:
https://eduplanner-frontend.vercel.app

---

## Features

* Create, update, and delete tasks
* Multiple task statuses:

  * Yet to Start
  * Partially Completed
  * Not Completed
  * Completed
* Edit task functionality
* Search tasks by title or description
* Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)
* Dashboard statistics
* Responsive UI

---

## How It Works

1. User interacts with frontend UI
2. React sends API request via Axios
3. Backend processes request using Express
4. MongoDB stores/retrieves data
5. Response returned to frontend
6. UI updates dynamically

## Future Enhancements

* Authentication (JWT)
* User-specific task management
* Deadline alerts
* Task priority system
* Dark mode
* Analytics dashboard
* Mobile optimization
